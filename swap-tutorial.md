# Swap Tutorial

Token swaps on PennySwap are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools. 

When you swap (trade) on the exchange, you will pay a 0.2% trading fee, of which 0.17% is returned to liquidity pools as a reward for liquidity providers and 0.03% to treasury.

Conversely, when you provide liquidity, you will earn that fee.
