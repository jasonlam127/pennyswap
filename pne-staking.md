# PNE Staking

When you deposit PNE in the stake page, you get xPNE in return as proof of your deposit. xPNE is itself a regular token, just like PNE. The amount of xPNE you get back is based on the amount of PNE already in the pool and the current total supply of xPNE. This ratio will be displayed on the pool and starts at 1 xPNE = 1 PNE, **it will continuously go up over time because of emission.**

**xPNE is required to redeem your PNE so do not spend it elsewhere!**

**Example:**

User A is the first to deposit in the PNE pool, they deposit 10 PNE and receive 10 xPNE as the initial ratio is 1:1

Next, there are 20 PNE enter the pool due to token emission, now there is 20 PNE. Since there are 20 PNE in the contract and 10 xPNE is the total supply, the ratio is now 1 xPNE : 2 PNE and User A can redeem his/her 10 xPNE for the 20 PNE at any time, based on that ratio. But let’s say they don’t do that.

Now, User B deposits 10 PNE to the pool and since the ratio is now 1 : 2, they get half of their deposit as xPNE, which would be 5 xPNE. Now the total pool is 30 PNE and total supply of xPNE is 15 (maintaining the ratio).

The ratio only changes as more PNE is emitted which is then sent to the pool and split equally among all xPNE holders, because each xPNE becomes worth more PNE (the share of PNE went up).
