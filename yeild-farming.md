# Yield Farming

The Farm page is the place to stake your psLP (Pennyswap Liquidity Pair tokens) to earn PNEs. These farms provide incentives to people providing liquidity to PennySwap and help offset Impermanent Loss risk.

## How to Stake Liquidity

If you have provided liquidity to a Liquidity Pool that is available for rewards (if not, please see Add Liquidity section), then now is the time to earn some PNE! It is really easy to do. 

1. **First find the pair** you wish to farm, and make the psLP for that pair on the Liquidity Page. We'll be farming PNE-SYS, earning PNE in this example

2. If this is your first time staking in this pool on PennySwap, you will need an approval from your wallet to begin the process. Click on **"Approve"**. This will prompt a transaction to approve our smart contracts handling your psLP tokens for that specific pool. 

3. Once that is done, click on the **"Stake"** button

5. You will be shown a modal where you can specify how many of your psLP tokens you wish to stake

5. Once you've decided, clicking **"Confirm"** will then prompt you with the transaction necessary to stake the tokens in our smart contracts. 

After that.. all you have to do is relax, and wait for the PNE to roll in!

## Yield Farm FAQ

**Will there be any fees for staking/depositing?**

No, staking here is completely fee-free.


**Are the APRs for real?!**

Yes, but as more liquidity pours into that pool, expect the APRs to go down naturally as your share of the pool scales down in size. The APRs also account for the trade fees, so as trading volume for that pair goes up, the fees you are collecting also go up.


**What will I be earning?**

By staking your liquidity token in a farm,  you are:

1. Collecting swapping fees whenever someone swaps between the pair you've provided. The amount of your psLP tokens will not increase, but the value they represent will. 
2. Earning PNEs based on the farm weight

The APR is calculated based on the last day's average of trading fees + the rate of PNEs earned for that farm.
